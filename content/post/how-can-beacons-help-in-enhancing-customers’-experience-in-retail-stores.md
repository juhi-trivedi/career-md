We all are aware of the traditional use of beacons such as in lighthouses, police car lights, etc. But with the advancing technology, beacons are nowadays widely used by the retailers for the purpose of advertisement and marketing of their products.  Beacons are usually small and they can be placed on the walls of the stores, both in and out. They produce signals which travel one way to nearby mobile devices. They transmit relevant information and targeted messages to likely patrons.



Retailers are using the beacon technology to gain insights about the customers’ behavior in the stores and then instruct them to perform certain actions using the mobile app.



The position of the customer is detected by the beacons and the coupons are sent to their mobile devices for their specific product, which they might be looking at.



Moreover, if the store’s app is on the customer’s device, the beacon can send special offers for items in the store that they might be eyeing in-store.



In some stores, the beacons are even placed inside the mannequins in the window display, which could be used to encourage the passersby to enter inside the store.



Let us explore how beacons are being used by the retailers to transform their business strategies to gain the maximum out of this technology.
